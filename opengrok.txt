-A .ext|prefix.:analyzer
        Files with the named prefix/extension should be analyzed with the specified class
-a on/off
        Allow or disallow leading wildcards in a search
-B url
        Base URL of the user Information provider. Default: "http://www.myserver.org/viewProfile.jspa?username="
-C
        Print per project percentage progress information(I/O extensive, since one read through dir structure is made be
fore indexing, needs -v, otherwise it just goes to the log)
-c /path/to/ctags
        Path to Exuberant Ctags from http://ctags.sf.net by default takes the Exuberant Ctags in PATH.
-d /path/to/data/root
        The directory where OpenGrok stores the generated data
-D
        Disable generating history for renamed files. Makes indexing faster for repositories with lots of renamed files.

-e
        Economical - consumes less disk space. It does not generate hyper text cross reference files offline, but will d
o so on demand - which could be sightly slow.
-G
        Assign commit tags to all entries in history for all repositories.
-H
        Generate history cache for all repositories
-h /path/to/repository
        just generate history cache for the specified repos (absolute path from source root)
-I pattern
        Only files matching this pattern will be examined (supports wildcards, example: -I *.java -I *.c)
-i pattern
        Ignore the named files (prefix with 'f:') or directories (prefix with 'd:') (supports wildcards, example: -i *.s
o -i *.dll)
-k /path/to/repository
        Kill the history cache for the given repository and exit. Use '*' to delete the cache for all repositories.
-K
        List all repository paths and exit.
-L path
        Path to the subdirectory in the web-application containing the requested stylesheet. The following factory-defau
lts exist: "default", "offwhite" and "polished"
-l on/off
        Turn on/off locking of the Lucene database during index generation
-m number
        Amount of memory that may be used for buffering added documents and deletions before they are flushed to the Dir
ectory(default 16.0MB). Please increase JVM heap accordingly, too.
-N /path/to/symlink
        Allow this symlink to be followed. Option may be repeated. By default only symlinks directly under source root d
irectory are allowed.
-n
        Do not generate indexes, but process all other command line options
-O on/off
        Turn on/off the optimization of the index database as part of the indexing step
-o path
        File with extra command line options for ctags
-P
        Generate a project for each of the top-level directories in source root
-p /path/to/default/project

 set either in cookie or in parameter). May be used multiple times for several projects. Use "__all__" for all projects.
 You should strip off the source root.
-Q on/off
        Turn on/off quick context scan. By default only the first 1024k of a file is scanned, and a '[..all..]' link is

 available CPUs
-t number
        Default tabsize to use (number of spaces per tab character)
-U host:port
        Send the current configuration to the specified address (This is most likely the web-app configured with ConfigA

-W /path/to/configuration

n
-w webapp-context

ame. Also FULL reindex is needed if this is changed.
